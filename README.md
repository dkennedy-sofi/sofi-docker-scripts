# sofi-docker-scripts
My scripts for docker clean, pull and restart

These are "fish" scripts - https://fishshell.com/ - but can easily be converted to bash.

Clean, pull and restart:
sofidev -c

Pull and restart:
sofidev -p

Restart:
sofidev -r

The 'sofidev' function requires dco, dma and dfo functions.
